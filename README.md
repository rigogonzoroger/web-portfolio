# Rodrigo's Web Portfolio

## About This Project
This is my personal web portfolio website built for my web development class. It includes a homepage with a short introduction and a technical skills table
a projects page showing some fun example projects, and a contact page with a simple form. The site is built with HTML and CSS and is designed to be clean,
simple, and responsive so it works on phones, tablets, and desktops.

## What I Learned
- I learned how to build and organize a website using proper HTML structure, including using tags like header, nav, main, section, and footer to keep everything clean and easy to understand.
- I learned a lot about styling with CSS, especially how to use Flexbox and media queries to make the layout look good on any screen size, whether it's a phone, tablet, or desktop.
- I also learned how to use GitHub and GitHub Pages to upload my files, track my changes, and publish a live website online.


## Next Steps
If I had more time, I would add javascript to make the site more interactive. One feature I would like to add is a filter or buttons on the Projects page so visitors 
can click a category for example Food Projects or Fun Projects and use JavaScript to show or hide certain project cards without reloading the page. In the future,
I might also rebuild this portfolio using a front-end framework or other third-party tools to make it easier to update as I add more projects.
